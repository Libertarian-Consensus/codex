# Code of Libertarian Consensus

This repository contains a code of libertarian consensus, an ethical framework based on the principles of Libertarianism and Murray Rothbard's ethics of liberty. Our purpose is to establish a set of principles that promote individual freedom, respect for private property, and the principle of non-aggression. 🗽💼🤝

## Purpose

The code of libertarian consensus aims to ensure individual freedom and justice by promoting a society based on fundamental ethical principles. We seek to create an environment where each individual can exercise autonomy and pursue their own objectives while adhering to a well-founded code of ethics. The idea is to enable a libertarian system of justice. 🌍🔒🚀

## Fundamental Principles

Our principles can be summarized in one paragraph:

"We uphold the fundamental principles of Libertarianism: individual freedom, private property, non-aggression, and self-determination. We believe in the inalienability of the right to self-determination and value privacy as an integral part of individual freedom." 🙌📜🔐

## Target Audience

The code of libertarian consensus is intended for those who share libertarian values and wish to contribute to the construction of a society based on individual freedom and respect for individual rights. It is a call to individuals committed to justice, non-aggression, and the pursuit of individual happiness within a voluntary social order. 👥🤝🌱

## View on the State

We understand that the State has an inherent tendency towards power concentration and violation of individual rights. We reject all forms of coercive power concentration. We reject Democracy and the Democratic Rule of Law, as well as any form of socialism that aims at resource reallocation. We reject the idea of revolution as a means to achieve objectives. Any coup that employs coercion and violence is equivalent to the State and its criminals.

Our vision is of a society free from the State, based on free trade, where human interactions are voluntary and guided by ethical principles. We believe that voluntary cooperation and individual freedom are the pillars for a prosperous and just society. 🚫🏛️✊
