# Tutorial: How to Use VS Code for Text Editing on GitHub

GitHub is a widely used platform for collaboration on software development projects. However, it can also be useful for editing and collaborating on text documents. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use VS Code, a popular text editor, in conjunction with GitHub to edit texts, even if you have no programming knowledge.

## Step 1: Installing VS Code

1. Visit the VS Code website at https://code.visualstudio.com and download and install the editor for your operating system.
2. Once the installation is complete, open VS Code.

## Step 2: Creating a GitHub Account

1. Go to the GitHub website at https://github.com and create an account if you don't have one already. Simply fill out the registration form with your personal information.
2. After creating your account, log in to GitHub.

## Step 3: Cloning the Libertarian Consensus Repository

1. Access the Libertarian Consensus repository at https://github.com/your-username/libertarian-consensus (replace "your-username" with your GitHub username).
2. Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository link.

## Step 4: Opening the Repository in VS Code

1. Open VS Code and click on "File" in the top menu.
2. Select "Open Repository" (or "Open Folder," depending on the version of VS Code).
3. Paste the repository link you copied earlier and press Enter.
4. VS Code will download the repository to your computer.

## Step 5: Editing the File in VS Code

1. In the left sidebar of VS Code, navigate to the cloned repository folder.
2. Click on the file you want to edit, such as "README.md."
3. The file will open in the VS Code editor.
4. Make the necessary changes to the text, such as adding information, correcting errors, or improving formatting.

## Step 6: Describing Your Changes

1. After making the changes, click on "Source Control" in the left sidebar of VS Code (tree branch icon).
2. The modifications made to the file will be displayed.
3. Enter a descriptive message about your changes in the "Message" text box at the top of the window.
4. For example, you can write: "Adding information about the principle of freedom."

## Step 7: Saving and Pushing the Changes

1. Click on the checkmark button (âœ“) above the message box to confirm the changes.
2. Then click on the "..." button next to the checkmark button and select "Push" to send the changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

## Step 8: Creating a Pull Request

1. After pushing the changes, access the repository on GitHub via the link: https://github.com/your-username/libertarian-consensus (replace "your-username" with your GitHub username).
2. On the repository page, click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
3. Then click on the "New Pull Request" button.
4. Fill in the title and description for your Pull Request, describing the changes that were made.
5. Click "Create Pull Request" to finalize the Pull Request creation.
